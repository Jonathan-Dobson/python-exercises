# Part 2
# Welcome to your first project.  Develop a catalog for a company. Assume that this company sells three different Items. The seller can sell individual items or a combination of any two items. A gift pack is a special combination that contains all three items. Here are some special considerations:

# A. If a customer purchases individual items, he does not receive any discount.


# B. If a customer purchases a combo pack with two unique items, he gets a 10% discount.
combo_pack_discount = 0.10
# def combo_pack(item1, item2):
#     discount = 0.10
#     total_price = item1 + item2
#     discount_price = total_price - (total_price * discount)
#     return discount_price


# C. If the customer purchases a gift pack, he gets a 25% discount.
gift_pack_discount = 0.25
# def gift_pack(item1, item2, item3):
#     discount = 0.25
#     total_price = item1 + item2 + item3
#     discount_price = total_price - (total_price * discount)
#     return discount_price


# Write a function for the above scenario. Perform the calculations in code wherever applicable.  The function should be your own creation, not copied from any other source.  The final output should look like:
# def apply_discount(*items):
#     print(len(items), "items")

#     if len(items) == 1:
#         return items[0][0]
#     elif len(items) == 2:
#         return items[0] + items[1] - (items[0] + items[1] * combo_pack_discount)
#     elif len(items) == 3:
#         return (
#             items[0]
#             + items[1]
#             + items[2]
#             - (items[0] + items[1] + items[2] * gift_pack_discount)
#         )


# items = [("Item 1", 200), ("Item 2", 400), ("Item 3", 600)]
